# SpaceEscapers
University project that consists of a first person melee game, made in Unity in 3 days so it is small and the enemies are kinda dumb

it has music, sound effects, weird minotaur alien enemies(i know...) and a green ship in honor to MexicoÂ´s best football team Santos Laguna

- To everyone who uploads free stuff to Unity Shop i love you
- To GitHub and Git, i hate your 100mb limit
- to Git LFS creators i love you
